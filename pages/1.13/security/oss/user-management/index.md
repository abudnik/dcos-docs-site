excerpt: Managing DC/OS user accounts
---

<!-- The source repository for this topic is https://github.com/dcos/dcos-docs-site -->

DC/OS can manage three types of user accounts:

* **External**: External users accounts are created by storing only the user ID inside DC/OS. External users log in to DC/OS by following a browser-based Single-Sign-On flow. DC/OS never receives or stores the passwords of external users. Instead, it delegates the verification of the userâ€™s credentials to the Auth0 identity provider instance managed by Mesosphere. The Auth0 instance is configured for three login providers: Google, GitHub and Microsoft.
* **Regular**: Regular user accounts exist inside DC/OS. Users log in via their username and password stored in CockroachDB on the master nodes.
* **Service**: Service accounts credentials are stored in CockroacDB inside DC/OS.Service accounts exist for long running services that need to refresh DC/OS authentication tokens autonomously. Services log in via service login tokens. Service accounts make it easy to integrate systems with the DC/OS security architecture.

User accounts can be added via the web interface, [DC/OS CLI](/1.13/cli) or via the [IAM API](/1.13/security/oss/iam-api/) depending on the user account type.
For backwards compatibility reasons a command line script for adding external users is shipped with every DC/OS cluster.

Users can be granted access to DC/OS by another authorized user. To bootstrap this process a default external user is automatically created by the first user who logs in to the DC/OS cluster via the web interface.

<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong>Any user with access to DC/OS can invite more users. Each DC/OS user is an administrator, there is no explicit concept of privileges with DC/OS.</p>
