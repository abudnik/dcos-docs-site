excerpt: Managing DC/OS users

<!-- The source repository for this topic is https://github.com/dcos/dcos-docs-site -->

DC/OS can manage two types of users:

* **External**: External users follow a browser-based Single-Sign-On flow for logging in to DC/OS. DC/OS never receives or stores the passwords of external users. Instead, it delegates the verification of the userâ€™s credentials to the Auth0 identity provider instance managed by Mesosphere. Only the user ID of one of the three available login providers Google, GitHub or Microsoft is stored inside DC/OS.
* **Local**: Local user accounts exist inside the DC/OS cluster. The credentials are stored in CockroachDB running on master nodes.

Users can be added via the web interface, [DC/OS CLI](/1.13/cli) or via the [IAM API](/1.13/security/oss/iam-api/) depending on the user type.
For backwards compatibility reasons a command line script for adding external users is shipped with every DC/OS cluster.

Users can be granted access to DC/OS by another authorized user. To bootstrap this process a default external user is automatically created by the first user who logs in to the DC/OS cluster via the web interface.

<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong>Any user with access to DC/OS can invite more users. Each DC/OS user is an administrator, there is no explicit concept of privileges with DC/OS.</p>
