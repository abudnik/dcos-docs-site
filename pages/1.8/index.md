- [Explore the Release Notes for 1.11](/1.11/release-notes/1.11.0/) or skip on over to [Upgrading to 1.11](/1.11/installing/production/upgrading/)

<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong> Operators can now jump to later versions of DC/OS along specific upgrade paths rather than by major release iteration.
